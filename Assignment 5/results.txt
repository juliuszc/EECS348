What feature(s) did you try?

We used curvature and box area.
Were they continuous or discrete?

They were discrete.
How did you determine thresholds for discrete features? How well did it work?

We did LOTS of trial and error for the numbers until we got results that seemed pretty good. Additionally, we decided that a higher curvature was more likely to be a drawing (based on viewing the images), and that a higher box area would likely be a drawing since they can be more spread out than a text.
